## Implement a design from scratch

## Concepts
For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:

**Implement a design**  
In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledge that you learned previously.

You won't have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.

Here is the final result:

![Webpage](path/to/image)

This webpage has been designed by Nicolas Philippot, UI/UX designer. You can find the final screens [here](path/to/screens).

## Requirements
- You are not allowed to import external CSS framework (like Bootstrap).
- You are not allowed to use JavaScript.
- Manual QA review must be done (request it when you are done with the project).
